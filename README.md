# Recipes

This project is a part of the [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum on programming as a practical [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) on basic HTML and CSS concepts.

All recipes have simple HTML structure and include different types of headers, ordered and unordered lists.
